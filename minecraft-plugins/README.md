# Minecraft Plugins
A collection of Minecraft plugins that I utilize whenever playing Minecraft. I
tend to take extended breaks between server versions while I focus on other
areas. I will update these plugins for major updates, both server and plugin 
wise.

## Plugin List
[sdSingleSleep](https://github.com/stoladev/java-projects/tree/master/minecraft-plugins/sd-single-sleep)
- sdSingleSleep allows the multiplayer server's players to switch the world's
active night or thunderstorm to a sunny day, overriding the need for all
players to sleep at the same time.

[sdSkills](https://github.com/stoladev/java-projects/tree/master/minecraft-plugins/sd-skills)
- sdSkills creates a RuneScape inspired skilling system that incorporates gains
within skills through experience by completing certain actions. The current
skills are Combat, Mining, Farming, Woodcutting, and Agility. Players are
required to have certain levels to either mine an ore, use a specific tool, or
chop at a certain speed. Perks related to a player's current skill level are
soon to come.
