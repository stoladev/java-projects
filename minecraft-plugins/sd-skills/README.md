# sdSkills
- sdSkills creates a RuneScape inspired skilling system that incorporates gains
within skills through experience by completing certain actions. The current
skills are Combat, Mining, Farming, Woodcutting, and Agility. Players are
required to have certain levels to either mine an ore, use a specific tool, or
chop at a certain speed. Perks related to a player's current skill level are
soon to come.
